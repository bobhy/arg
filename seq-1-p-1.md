# Page editing
## How do I format paragraphs?
I assume all the markdown tricks work
Here is a list:
* item one
* Item 2
* 3

a numbered list?
1. foo
2. bar
3. bas

a todo list?
- [x] first
- [ ] second

Interestingly, the editor has the notion of continuing items in the same kind of list.
I wonder whether there are other tricks, e.g for definition lists?

term
: definition one
other term
:  another definition.
